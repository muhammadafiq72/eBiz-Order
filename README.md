The mobile application is developed for any business owner that would like to manage their business better. If the business owner agrees to use the mobile application, it will also be used by their dropshippers and stockists. Orders will be more manageable with this application compared to ordering via messaging applications that need to have many messages sent in and out. Sometimes, the messages could be overlooked and the order will not be received by the supplier.
